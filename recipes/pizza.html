    <p>Description</p>
    <p>Pizza is the ultimate crowd-pleasing dish, featuring a crispy thin crust, tangy tomato sauce, melted mozzarella,
        and your favorite toppings. This classic homemade version makes one 12-inch pizza (serves 2-4 people) and takes
        about 1 hour total (including baking time), plus dough rising time.</p>
    <p>Serve with a fresh green salad or antipasto for a perfect casual meal!</p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough (homemade or store-bought)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings (e.g., pepperoni, basil, mushrooms, olives)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) or as high as it goes, ideally with a pizza stone or baking sheet inside
            to heat up.</li>
        <li>If using homemade dough, prepare it in advance: mix 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon yeast, 1 teaspoon salt, and 3/4
            cup warm water; knead and let rise for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Roll or stretch the dough into a 12-inch circle on a floured surface or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a border for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle generously with shredded mozzarella cheese, then add your chosen toppings like pepperoni slices and
            fresh basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Drizzle lightly with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and dried oregano if desired.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated stone or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes until the crust is golden and bubbly, and the cheese is melted and lightly browned.
            Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
