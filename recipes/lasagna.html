    <ol>
        <li>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). </li>
        <li>For the meat sauce, brown 1 pound of ground beef (or a mix of beef and Italian sausage) in a large skillet
            over medium heat, then add 1 diced onion and 3 minced garlic cloves, cooking until softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes, 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1 teaspoon dried basil, 1 teaspoon
            dried oregano, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 20-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix 15 ounces ricotta cheese with 1 egg, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, and 2 tablespoons
            chopped fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of no-boil lasagna noodles (or cooked regular noodles), followed by ricotta mixture, shredded
            mozzarella (about 3 cups total for the dish), and more meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers 3-4 times, ending with meat sauce topped with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes, then uncover and bake another 25 minutes until bubbly and golden.
            Let it rest for 15 minutes before slicing to allow the layers to set.</li>
